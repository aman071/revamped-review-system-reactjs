      There us nothing to dislike about the product yet. I bought it for hiking and it served the purpose, went all out for 12 hours backup as promised, in snow, rain and dirt on my bike to ladakh.
This is a sturdy little beast with great loud sound clearly distinguishable on a bullet. Outright Worth-IT in this price bracket.
